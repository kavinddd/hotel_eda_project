# About the project
The hotel booking data is from Kaggle website, since I'm a hospitality student studyding about hotels management, so I tried to apply my data knowledge enhancing my hotel knowledge. This was actually my first personal project doing all the things from cleaning untill evaluating the final model.
## What I did?
- Cleaning and preparing data
- EDA to answer five questions
- Building a simple logistic regression to predict canceled bookings.
